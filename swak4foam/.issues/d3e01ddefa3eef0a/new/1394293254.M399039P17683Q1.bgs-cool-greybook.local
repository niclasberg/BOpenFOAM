Subject: Make global variables available in pythonIntegration functionObjects
Message-Id: <d3e01ddefa3eef0a-0-artemis@bgs-cool-greybook.local>

Currently for python-integration that builds a function the global
variables are not available out of the box and must be declared with
globals

Find a way to make them available anyway as this is most annoying for
the user
