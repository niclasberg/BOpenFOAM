Subject: Properly rewrite recalcLimits in SimpleDistribution
Message-Id: <ff6d0943ee55c2da-0-artemis@workstation008.office.ice-sf.at>

When called from calcScalarWeights and weights are 0 this does not
work properly. Currently there is a workaround in the only method that
needs this but it should be rewritten properly
